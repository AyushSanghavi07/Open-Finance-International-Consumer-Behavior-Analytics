    "# 🏦 Open Finance & International Consumer Behavior Analytics  \n",
    "## 📘 Main Machine Learning & Data Preparation Notebook (Master’s Dissertation)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the **analytical backbone** of the Open Finance & International Consumer Behavior Analytics project.  \n",
    "It provides a complete, reproducible workflow used to build all machine learning components that power the Streamlit application (`app.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is intentionally designed to be:\n",
    "- **Supervisor-friendly**  \n",
    "- **Publication-ready**  \n",
    "- **Fully reproducible**  \n",
    "- **Aligned with industry modelling practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ 1. Loads and audits the Global Findex dataset  \n",
    "- Performs column cleanup  \n",
    "- Normalizes naming conventions  \n",
    "- Handles missing values  \n",
    "- Ensures numerical consistency  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ 2. Conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  \n",
    "- Distribution analysis  \n",
    "- Correlation matrix  \n",
    "- Country-level adoption trends  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ 3. Engineers Behavioral & Open Finance Features  \n",
    "Includes simulated variables that matter in fintech adoption:\n",
    "- Age  \n",
    "- Privacy concern  \n",
    "- Digital literacy  \n",
    "- Sentiment proxy  \n",
    "- Binary adoption flag  \n",
    "\n",
    "These are used as model features in your Streamlit app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ 4. Trains ML Models  \n",
    "- **Random Forest Classifier**  \n",
    "- **K-Means Clustering (3 segments)**  \n",
    "- Generates metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, feature importance  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ 5. Exports All Artefacts for `app.py`\n",
    "The app loads these files:\n",
    "- `rf_model.pkl` → Predictive model  \n",
    "- `kmeans_model.pkl` → Segmentation engine  \n",
    "- `sample_df.csv` → Processed dataset  \n",
    "- `rf_accuracy.npy` → Stored accuracy value  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ 6. Automatically Launches Streamlit  \n",
